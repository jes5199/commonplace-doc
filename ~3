Let's fix P1 bugs one by one, look in beads and find one to solve. If there are no P1s remaining, run through docs/plans/2026-01-02-sandbox-sync-acceptance-criteria.md from the top until you find a bug. File that bug as a bead and then fix it. Use a local codex review loop. When you are done, start again from the top until you can do the whole thing without finding any new bugs.
