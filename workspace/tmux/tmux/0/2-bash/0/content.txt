 if the process has died

**Currently:** Building the release binaries - the build has been running for ~2m 52s:
```
● Bash(cargo build --release --bin commonplace-ps --bin commonplace-orchestrator 2>&1)

Once the build finishes, it will likely test and commit the changes. The todo list still shows both items unchecked, but the code changes are done -

commit b799acc6835b6b241b6ae38d674a8118e58009fd (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
Author: Jes Wolfe! <jes5199@gmail.com>

    CP-6kk: Remove non-recursive mode from orchestrator

    Orchestrator now always:
    1. Starts server and sync from commonplace.json
    2. Recursively discovers all processes.json files
    3. Manages discovered processes dynamically

    Removed flags:
    - --recursive (always on now)
    - --watch-processes (replaced by recursive discovery)
    - --use-paths (only used with --watch-processes)

    Kept --only for running a single base process from config.

    CP-4qm: Now works from outside the sync directory by starting the
    workspace root search from the file's directory, not the current
    working directory.

    CP-n0x: Default output now shows total commit count and hints at
    --list flag, so users discover the full history is available.
