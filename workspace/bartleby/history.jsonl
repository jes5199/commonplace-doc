{"prompt":"[2026-01-21 09:38:20] what is window 0 doing?","response":"Let me check the correct path structure:\nWindow 0 (`commonplace`) is running Claude Code and is in the middle of a **Wiggum loop** - an iterative implementation task. Here's what's happening:\n\n**Current task**: Comparing the sync client code against the new CRDT peer sync design document (`docs/plans/2026-01-21-crdt-peer-sync-design.md`) and fixing divergences one by one.\n\n**Loop setup**: 20 max iterations, completion criteria is \"CODE MATCHES DESIGN\"\n\n**Session context**: Earlier in this session, they:\n1. Designed a new CRDT peer sync architecture (sync client as a true peer, not a mirror)\n2. Got Codex to review it twice, incorporated feedback\n3. Committed the design doc\n4. Filed CP-4kp4 as the implementation ticket\n5. Just started the Wiggum loop to systematically bring the code in line with the design\n\n**Current state**: The Claude instance is \"Musing...\" (thinking) at iteration 1, about to start asking Codex to identify the first divergence between code and design.","timestamp":"2026-01-21T09:38:46.761249"}
