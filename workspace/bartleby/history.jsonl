{"prompt":"[2026-01-06 04:27:09] look now","response":"Hmm, commonplace returned empty. Let me check if the window still exists or if it scrolled differently:\nOh interesting! The window got renamed from \"commonplace\" to \"js-evaluator\" (window 7). Let me check that one:\n**Commonplace** (now renamed to \"js-evaluator\") is crushing it! \n\n✅ **Tasks 1-5 complete:**\n- Task 1: ts/js extensions\n- Task 2: SDK skeleton  \n- Task 3: /sdk endpoint\n- Task 4: evaluate key in ProcessEntry\n- Task 5: Evaluate process spawning\n\n🔄 **Currently on Task 6:** Implementing SDK `output.set()` with MQTT (31 minutes in, actively thinking)\n\n4 more tasks to go (7-10).

{"prompt":"[2026-01-08 03:13:49] can you see window 0 right now?","response":"Interesting - windows.json says `@0` should be `0-commonplace`, but there's no `0-commonplace` directory in the listing. Let me check if maybe the directory just hasn't been synced:\n**I can't see window 0 right now.** \n\nThe `windows.json` says window 0 should be `0-commonplace`, but there's no `0-commonplace` directory synced to the filesystem. The available windows are:\n\n- 1-codex\n- 3-file-tmux-file\n- 5-jes\n- 6-grimoire\n- 7-bash\n\nWindow 0 (commonplace) and window 2 (bash) are listed in windows.json but their directories don't exist. The file-tmux-file sync may not be capturing them, or they could have been closed/renamed.\n\nWould you like me to check one of the other windows instead?","timestamp":"2026-01-08T03:14:16.803073"}
{"prompt":"[2026-01-08 03:14:47] it probably crashed tbh","response":"Yeah, that would explain it - if the `file-tmux-file` sync process crashed, it would stop updating the window directories. The existing directories (1-codex, 3-file-tmux-file, 5-jes, etc.) are stale from when it was last running.\n\nLet me check the file-tmux-file window itself to see if there's any error output:\nAh, looks like the **file-tmux-file sync process was killed** (lines 91-111 show `kill 1158` and then `kill -9 1158`). That's why window 0 isn't being synced anymore - the sync daemon is dead.\n\nThis content is also stale (from before the kill). So yeah, file-tmux-file crashed or was intentionally killed, and the window directories stopped updating. Window 0 (`0-commonplace`) never got its directory created after that point.\n\nWant me to check one of the other windows that *does* have content, or is this enough context for your debugging?","timestamp":"2026-01-08T03:15:07.750503"}
