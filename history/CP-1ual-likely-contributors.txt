CP-1ual likely contributors (ordered by likelihood)

1) CRDT init race
   - When needs_server_init() is true, CRDT merge is skipped and the client falls back to a server fetch.
   - If the edit arrives before the server has processed it, the fetch returns stale content and the edit is lost.
   - Symptom match: empty file or missing edit after initial create.
   - Bead: CP-hykz.

2) Broadcast lag without resync
   - recv_broadcast() logs Lagged and continues, but no resync occurs.
   - Missed edits are permanently lost for that session.
   - Symptom match: later edits silently fail to land.
   - Bead: CP-oah1.

3) Watcher reads unstable files
   - Create/modify events can fire before content is fully written (temp file + rename, editor swap).
   - Empty or partial reads can be published as real edits.
   - Symptom match: file created but empty or truncated.
   - Bead: CP-gz0p.

4) Echo suppression or fallback writes interfering with real edits
   - Echo suppression/fallback write paths can block legitimate remote updates or cause echo loops.
   - Symptom match: sandbox -> workspace edits not propagating.
   - Beads: CP-qqgi (echo suppression removal), CP-dkqk (pipeline investigation).

5) MQTT retain/QoS strategy inconsistencies
   - If retained edits or QoS are inconsistent, late-joining peers miss updates.
   - Symptom match: sandbox joins and never receives the latest content.
   - Bead: CP-w41r.

6) Subscription timing vs schema updates
   - Schema update triggers UUID subscription; content edit can arrive before subscription is active.
   - Fetch then returns empty or stale content.
   - Symptom match: initial create OK but subsequent content missing.
   - Related to CP-hykz and CP-dkqk.
