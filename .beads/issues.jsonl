{"id":"CP-r2a","title":"Fix sync race condition: upload_task sends stale content during B-\u003eA sync","description":"When a server edit arrives via SSE, the handle_server_edit function fetches HEAD and writes to the local file. However, the file watcher can trigger upload_task with stale file content before the write completes, causing the old content to be synced back to the server.\n\nRoot cause: Echo detection relies on comparing file content to last_written_content, but there's a window between SSE notification and file write where upload_task can read stale content.\n\nPossible fixes:\n1. Add a flag to pause upload_task during server writes\n2. Use file modification timestamp comparison\n3. Add sequence numbers to track edit origin","design":"## Extended Barrier Pattern - REVISED AFTER CODEX REVIEW\n\n### Codex-Identified Issues:\n\n**CRITICAL: Partial writes can still trigger uploads**\nIf watcher fires during our write, content differs from pending, we upload partial/corrupted content. FIX: Don't immediately upload on mismatch - retry/re-read until content stabilizes or matches pending.\n\n**HIGH: Multiple server edits clobber pending fields**\nIf handle_server_edit runs while barrier is up, it overwrites pending_write_*, causing misclassification when first write's watcher event arrives. FIX: Use generation token (monotonic write_id) so barrier maps to exact write.\n\n**HIGH: Upload with stale parent_cid may fail**\nServer's replace endpoint may reject if parent doesn't match HEAD. FIX: Refresh HEAD before upload, or use CRDT edit endpoint for merges.\n\n**MEDIUM: Window between re-check and barrier set**\nLocal edit can slip in between re-check and write_in_progress=true. FIX: Do both atomically under write lock.\n\n**MEDIUM: Read→drop→write lock pattern is risky**\nState can change between drop(read) and acquire(write). FIX: Re-check under write lock, or use single write lock.\n\n**LOW: Watcher never fires leaves barrier stuck**\nlast_written_cid never updates, next upload uses stale parent. FIX: Timeout/fallback to finalize barrier.\n\n---\n\n### Improved Design: Token-Based Barrier\n\n```rust\nstruct SyncState {\n    last_written_cid: Option\u003cString\u003e,\n    last_written_content: String,\n    // Token-based barrier:\n    current_write_id: u64,  // Monotonic counter\n    pending_write: Option\u003cPendingWrite\u003e,\n}\n\nstruct PendingWrite {\n    write_id: u64,\n    content: String,\n    cid: String,\n    started_at: Instant,\n}\n```\n\n**handle_server_edit:**\n1. Acquire write lock\n2. If pending_write exists and not timed out, queue/skip this edit\n3. Increment current_write_id\n4. Set pending_write = Some(PendingWrite { write_id, content, cid, started_at })\n5. Release lock\n6. Write file\n7. Do NOT clear barrier (upload_task does it)\n\n**upload_task:**\n1. Read file content\n2. Acquire write lock (not read!)\n3. If pending_write exists:\n   a. If content == pending.content AND file stable (re-read matches):\n      - Clear pending, update last_written_*, done (echo)\n   b. If content != pending.content:\n      - Re-read file after short delay (50ms)\n      - If still differs after N retries: user edited, clear pending, upload\n   c. If pending.started_at \u003e 30s ago: timeout, clear pending\n4. Normal echo detection if no pending\n\n**Key improvements:**\n- Retry on mismatch instead of immediate upload (avoids partial writes)\n- Token prevents clobbering from concurrent server edits\n- Single write lock avoids ABA bugs\n- Timeout prevents stuck barrier\n- Refresh HEAD before upload on conflict path","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-29T16:02:47.797530633Z","created_by":"jes","updated_at":"2025-12-29T19:42:52.974768922Z"}
