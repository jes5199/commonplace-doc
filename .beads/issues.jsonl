{"id":"CP-oji","title":"Handle rename events so new paths get sync tasks","description":"notify reports renames as `Modify(Name)` events; the current mapping treats all `is_modify()` as `DirEvent::Modified`. The modified handler only re-pushes schema and never starts new per-file sync tasks or removes old ones, so a rename leaves the new file untracked and the old path's tasks running until restart.\n\nConsider handling rename explicitly (or treating `Modify(Name)` as delete+create).","design":"Implemented by detecting `Modify(Name)` events separately from other modifications in the directory watcher. Rename events are now classified as delete+create based on RenameMode: From→Deleted, To→Created, Both/Any/Other→check path.exists() to determine direction. This ensures sync tasks are properly stopped for old paths and started for new paths.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-26T17:03:59.632881-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-26T17:49:57.531409-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-26T17:49:57.531409-08:00","close_reason":"Rename events now handled properly - Modify(Name) events are classified as delete+create based on RenameMode.

{"id":"CP-uj2","title":"Represent directory trees as Yjs JSON (Y.Map) instead of text JSON","description":"Currently, the fs-root document uses TEXT content type with JSON stored as a text string. This was a workaround because the edit system (diff.rs, replay.rs) uses TEXT-based Yjs updates (Y.Text), but DocumentNode for JSON type uses Y.Map internally.\n\nThe proper solution would be to use native Yjs JSON structure (Y.Map) for directory schemas, which would enable:\n- Proper CRDT merging of concurrent schema changes\n- More efficient updates (only changed entries, not full document replacement)\n- Better conflict resolution for concurrent file additions/deletions","design":"Implemented Y.Map support:\n\n1. replay.rs: Extended get_content_and_state_at_commit to support JSON content type by initializing Y.Map root and using map.to_json() for extraction.\n\n2. sync.rs: Added create_yjs_map_update() and json_value_to_any() helper to convert JSON strings to Y.Map updates.
