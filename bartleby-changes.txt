# Bartleby changes for CP-6pd: Use cwd instead of BARTLEBY_WORKING_DIR

## File: bartleby.py

### Change 1: Remove os import (line 7)
Remove: import os

### Change 2: Update WORKING_DIR (lines 13-15)
Old:
```python
# File paths
BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).parent
WORKING_DIR = Path(os.environ.get("BARTLEBY_WORKING_DIR", BASE_DIR / "working")).resolve()
```

New:
```python
# File paths - uses current working directory (set by orchestrator via cwd)
WORKING_DIR = Path.cwd().resolve()
```

## Rationale
When the orchestrator spawns bartleby with `cwd` set to the workspace directory,
bartleby will naturally use that as its working directory. This is simpler and
more transparent than relying on environment variables.

The orchestrator config sets: "cwd": "/path/to/workspace"
Bartleby then uses Path.cwd() to get the workspace directory.
